        <section id="welcome-section">

        <p class="paragraph-info">I'm Franklyn Rodriguez. I'm pivoting into software development from an occupational therapy healthcare field. I previously worked as an occupational therapist, where I spearheaded functional skills-based initiatives for marginalized differently-abled clients in the school and psychiatry settings. My interest in software development was sparked when assisting clients in using assistive devices to access websites/apps. I graduated from Ada Developer Academy C18 cohort as a full-stack software developer. I completed my internship at Cerebral a healthcare company that provides medication and counseling services to it’s clients.

            I'm interested in making technology more accessible for people of all abilities. I want to find an opportunity where I can process improvement, promote positive community experiences, take on challenges, and continue learning. In my spare time I volunteer in the tech world, teaching coding fundamentals to school-age children and as a member of AnitaB.Org. You can connect with me on Linkedin <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/franklyn-rodriguez-softwaredeveloper/">here</a>.

        <h1>Skills</h1>
        <section id="skill-section">
        <p class="paragraph-info"> During my time at Ada Developers Academy, I learned to code in <span>Python</span>, <span>React</span>, <span>HTML/CSS</span>, <span>Javascript</span> and  created databases using <span>Postgres</span>. My capstone project focused on those core technologies with the inclusion of <span>Google Firestore</span> and accessibility within the UI.

            While at Cerebral, I deepened my knowledge of <span>React</span> and <span>accessibility</span>. I learned <span>Typescript</span>, <span>NestJS</span>, and <span> Ruby on Rails</span> through my contribution to numerous projects. I was also able to improve my understanding of <span>Git Versioning</span> and improve collaboration skills.
